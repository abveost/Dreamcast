This is a set of scripts to do one very specific task.  Convert all redump zips in a directory to a set of files to be used with GDEMU.  Currently it does nothing else.  Hopefully someone will find this or parts of it useful or can adapt it to do what they want.  This software is licensed under the GPLv3.

Requirements:

bash (with basic set of commands, ls, cp, mv, unzip, maybe a few more)
python
node.js
gdi-utils
bin/cdi4dc
bin/mkisofs
dat/IP.BIN
menu/1ST_READ.BIN

If you have any of the last two that can be included in this repo I'm happy to include them.  If you have source for cdi4dc I'd be interested in that as well.

List of scripts:

dooweet: A wrapper for all the scripts to copy/convert everything in a source folder to an SD for GDEMU

dcc: goes through all files in a folder, unzips them one by one to tmp, converts from redump to normal, shrinks, and moves the folder the output path, ie your SD using a sequential 2 digit directory name

reorder: rename directories in numerical order based on the name in track03.iso in each folder

build_list-ini: create a LIST.INI based on the data in track03.iso for each of those directories.

mk_menu: build a gdi with gemenu using IP.BIN and 1ST_READ.BIN+LIST.INI

2to3: reaname folders from 2 digit to 3 digit

Tested on windows using gitbash and cygwin bash
